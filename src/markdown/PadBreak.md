### Game Summary

This was a GameJam-type 3 days test for [Rec'im](https://recim.fr/) studio. <br/>I developed a hyper-casual game where you are controlling a ball and you have to stay on pads that have the same color as terrain borders. Borders are changeing color randomly every few seconds. You have a little store where you can buy new materials for your ball for coins that you gain in the game.
